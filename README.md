# A Game Engine (AGE)
### by Fayzulloh Ergashev

There are game engine source files which provide a framework for building games. They provide functionality to display blocks, and single characters and make them move. There's also functionality for defining crash-behaviour between entities.

So far only the snake game has been developed and uploaded to this repository, more games coming soon...
